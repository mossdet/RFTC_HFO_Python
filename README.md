Analysis of the connectivity between sEEG covered brain areas before and after thermocoagulation

## This project determines functional, epileptic and anatomical connectivity between SEEG covered brain areas and compares the connectivity changes after thermocoagulation.
### The functional connectivity is determined by multi-band amplitude correlation
### The epileptic connectivity is determined by the clustering of HFO activity
### The anatomical connectivity is determined by MRI analysis

### 1.Localizing SEEG electrodes in the FreeSurfer average brain:
